| The **Push swap** project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted. |
| You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. |
| Your goal? Write a program in C called **push_swap** which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of *Push swap language* instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.|
| Easy? |
| We’ll see... |

| Writing a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a developer’s journey. It is often the first encounter with the concept of [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms). |
| Sorting algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts since you’ll have to face them at some point. |
| The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms. Especially focusing on their complexity. |
| Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can differ. |
